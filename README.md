>AAC73586.1 is a copper transporter. It may also transport silver. It binds nucleotides and ATP. It is found in e.coli strain K-12.

>AAC73575.1 refolds protein. It is dependent on Hsp70. Hsp90 is its co-chaperone. It is found in E.coli strain K-12. It belongs to the heat schock protein 90 family.

>AAC73280.1 is a ribosomal subunit protein. It is part of the 30S ribosomal subunit. It contacts S1. It belongs to the ribosomal protein S2P family. It is involved in zinc ion binding.

>AAC73305.1 is a prolyl-tRNA synthetase. It is found in the K-12 strain of E-coli. It catalyzes the attachment of proline to tRNA in a two step reaction. First proline is activated. Then it is transferred to the acceptor end of tRNA.

>AAC73310.1 is a DL-methionine transporter subunit. It is found in the K-12 strain of e-coli. It imports methoinine. It is responsible for energy coupling to the transport system. It has been shown to be involved in Formyl-l-methionine transport.
